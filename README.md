## Concept

DKDBManager is a simple, yet very useful, CRUD manager around [Magical Record](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord). 

It implements a logic around the database that helps the developer to manage his entities and let him focus on other things than only data management.

The main concept is to import JSON dictionaries representing entities into the database. 

After some configuration on your model classes, only one single function is needed to _create_, _read_, _update_ or _delete_ your entities!

## Documentation

The complete documentation is available on [CocoaDocs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DKDBManager).

More over, the [Wiki](https://github.com/kevindelord/DKDBManager/wiki) contains all kind of information and details about the different logics of the library.
