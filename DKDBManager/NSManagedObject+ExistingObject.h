 * Returns YES if |managedObject| has been deleted from the Persistent Store, or NO if it has not.

 * (e.g. their -isDeleted method returns YES), but have not yet been commited
 * to the Persistent Store. YES will be returned only after a deleted
 * NSManagedObject has been committed to the Persistent Store.

 * |managedObject| has zero properties defined. If all your NSManagedObject's
 * in the data model have at least one property, this will not be an issue.
 *
 * Property == Attributes and Relationships

 * Mac OS X 10.4 and earlier are not supported, and will throw an exception.
